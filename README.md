# Vault

## Motivation
Imagine a client has a large set of potentially small files {F0, F1, â€¦, Fn}
and wants to upload them to a server and then delete its local copies.
The client wants, however, to later download an arbitrary file from the server
and be convinced that the file is correct and is not corrupted in any way
(in transport, tampered with by the server, etc.).

## Features
    [ ] Encryption directly from the CLI
    [ ] Authentication
